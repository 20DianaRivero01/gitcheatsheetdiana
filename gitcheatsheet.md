### git config --global alias.visual '!gitk'
to demostrate by aliasing

## GIT BRANCHING ##

### git branch <testing>
creates a new branch.
### git log --one line --decorate
show us where the branch pointers are pointing.
### git checkout <testing> 
switch an existing branch.
### git checkout master
switch back to the master branch.
### git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
it will print out the history of your commits, where your branch pointers are and how your history has diverged.


### git checkout -b <iss53>
creates a new branch and switch it at the same time.
### git merge <hotfix
merges the branch back into your master branch to deploy to production.
### git branch -d <hotfix>
deletes the hotfix branch.
### git mergetool
graphical tool to solve problems.


### git branch
List, create, or delete branches.
### git branch -v 
to see the last commit on each branch.
### git branch --merged
to see which branchs are already merged.
### git branch --no-merged
 to see which branchs haven't yet merged.
### git branch -vv"
to see what tracking branches you have set up.
### git fetch --all; git branch -vv
If you want totally up to date ahead and behind numbers, you’ll need to fetch from all your remotes right before running this. 
### git push origin --delete <serverflix>
to delete a remote branch/pointer from the server. 
### git rebase master Reapply
commits on top of another base tigit rebase --onto maste take changes on client that aren't on server and replay them on your master branch.
